# Cerni's VimConfig
This Vim Configuration created for vim usage mainly for lite coding and writing. It is optimised to work on Markdown, JS, C#, XML, HTML and CSS.

I divide this VimConfig into several files:

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| .vimrc | Main configuration which shown at ~/ |
| .vimrc.plugins | all plugin used in this configuration |
| .vimrc.config | main configuration, you usually see this within main .vimrc |
| .vimrc.keymaps | all keymaps to native vim command. Plugin's specific keymap not included here |
| .vimrc.plugin.config | configuration for plugins used in this vim configuration. Including keymaps |

I use [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) for plugin manager.

These are the plugins I put in this configuration:
